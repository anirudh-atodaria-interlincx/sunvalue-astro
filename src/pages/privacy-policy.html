<h5>8.	Your California Privacy Rights</h5>

</p>
<p><b>8.2</b> 	Personal Information Sales; Opt-Out And Opt-In Rights: To exercise the right to optout, you may submit a request to us via email at privacy@sunvalue.com. Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into personal information sales at any time by contacting us via email at privacy@sunvalue.com.</p>
<p><b>8.3</b> 	Limitations on Requests. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice within a twelve (12) month period. The verifiable consumer request must: (a) Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or your authorized agent; (b) Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to you; (c) We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.

<p><b>9.1.</b> We are not in a position to accept users who are not U.S. Citizens.
