				<h2>How Solar Panels Work</h2>
				<img class="post-img" src="../images/how-solar-panels-work.jpg" alt="">
				<div class="inner">
					<p>For many, the concept of being able to tap into the sun and produce energy that can power their home, business, or automobile is a mysterious phenomenon. Unlocking the power of the sun in just a few simple steps can not only save you thousands on utility bills but also help create a more sustainable world by reducing our carbon footprint. Here is how solar panels work to produce energy:</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>Solar Panel Technology</h4>
					<p>Solar panels work to convert sunlight into electricity that your home can use, reducing your electricity bills. Panels come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and use a range of solar cell technology. The very best panels work harder by maximizing every drop of solar energy available throughout the day. The very best solar panels on the market can produce 70% more energy than lesser solar panels over the course of 25 years*. Studies have shown that a solid copper foundation adds strength to panels, and ultra-pure silicon delivers optimal solar energy conversion.</p>
					<p>In fact, the world record efficiency of 24.2% delivers 44% more power per square foot of solar panels, meaning that they work to produce significantly more solar energy than panels made from other materials. It's also imperative that your panels are engineered and tested to stand up to the world's harshest conditions, including temperature swings, battering winds, humidity, hail, and more. If the design or quality of the solar panel is inferior, it could mean that you'll be producing significantly less solar energy. A well-certified system has been shown to yield solar energy for more than 40 years.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>Installing Solar Panels</h4>
					<p>Once you select the very highest quality solar panel technology, the placement of the solar panels is key to generating solar energy. Some of the most popular locations for panel installation are on the roof of your home or business, surrounding areas on the ground, or a solar canopy. Your solar company will input your home's dimensions into a Computer Assisted Design (CAD) program to aid in assembling a permit submittal packet. Once the solar company has determined which location will generate the most solar energy and the number of panels that will be installed, a typical solar system installation only takes a couple of days.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>Monitoring The System</h4>
					<p>Once your system is installed, you'll immediately start producing solar energy that can be used to run your lights, computers, machinery, and any other electrical devices for your home or business. A utility meter tracks your energy use and counts both ways. You will earn credits for solar power produced but not used because it is pushed back into the utility grid. The utility grid still provides you with electricity at night, when you're not producing enough solar power, but any credits earned during the day cover that cost.</p>
					<p>Remember, the amount of solar energy you're producing can change throughout the year based on where you live and how much sunlight your panels are receiving on a daily basis. To check on how much solar energy your panels are producing you can use your online monitoring system to track production. If you notice a significant variation, notify your solar company to ensure everything is working properly.</p>
